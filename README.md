# Overview
The idea behind this project is to create an Android application that enables users to select food that they already have in their pantry and return potential recipes that use that food. Other functionality may be added later. 

# Motivations
This project was created as an Undergraduate Capstone at the University of Virginia's College at Wise by Jared Ring, 
Viktor Tunnikov, and Andrii Rutnytskyi. The purpose of the capstone is to demonstrate various skills learned as an undergraduate. It is a requisite for graduation. 

# Features
*The features will be assigned a star based on importance of implementation. 
least important = *
Moderate importance = **
High importance = ***
Core functionality = ****

Intended Functionalities;
1. Take in user foods and give them recipes based on what they have. 
2. Take in a recipe and foods from user, tell the user what they needed. 
3. Provide an option to disallow some foods based on allergies.
4. Provide an option to show only vegan recipes.
5. Provide categories for breakfast,lunch, and dinner 
6. Provide healthy food categories. 
7. Provide Calorie/Nutrition Stats for each meal. 

Implemented Functionalities; 
1. 

# Technologies Used
This is predominately going to be written in Java and Javascript, since it is geared toward Android Use. Subsequently, the team chose to use Android Studio as a development IDE. 
The project will also make use of an as-yet unkown API for retrieving the recipes themselves. This will be done to avoid the additional workload of creating a recipe Database by hand. 
Also Git/Github as version control. 

# Meetings So Far
 1. Determined Application idea, technologies. Cleared with department chair.
 2. Decided approximately which languages to use, how the app would look. Resolved that each member of the group would make a drawing of how they wanted the GUI to look. 
 3. Andrii resolved to create photo assets, Jared to find a suitable API and learn to use it, Viktor to continue work on coding. Also resolved to use Github over Bitbucket and created the initial repository.
